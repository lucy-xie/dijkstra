# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Goals

- Implement a graph structure to represent the relationships between nodes and edges
- Create a min-heap-based priority queue for efficient processing of nodes
- Develop and implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path
- Identify the lowest cost path for various test cases using the implemented algorithm


## Description

This project is to demonstrate my ability to implement complex concepts. By implementing a graph structure, a min-heap-based priority queue, and Dijkstra's algorithm, I was able gain more experience in handling higher-level data structures and algorithms.

The primary objective of this assignment is to build a program that reads through a file containing nodes and their weights, create an adjacency list to represent the resulting graph, and then output the shortest path and calculate the total distance traveled.

In test2.txt, a real-world application is tested where airport destinations represented as nodes and plane prices as edges. The program efficiently calculates and outputs the optimal path that a traveler should take to achieve the most affordable travel experience.
